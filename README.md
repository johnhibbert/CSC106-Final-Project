# CSC106-Final-Project
My final project for CSC106 at the University of Rhode Island in the fall of 2014.

Introduction:

This is my final project for CSC106: The Joy of Programming.  The project was to create an Android application using MIT's AppInventor2.  We had to use some of the data structures, but otherwise we had free rein.  So, I created a maze navigation and enemy avoidance game called Hold The Onions.  The player is a hamburger trying to reassemble itself, while avoiding static mustard stains and onions chasing you.  It used the orientation sensor to move the player, and lists of lists to give each level the coordinates to place the obstacles.

Installation:

This application is for Android devices only.  There are two ways in which you could view this app.  Importing the project into Appinventor2 and running it in the MIT AI2 Companion, or downloading the APK directly onto the phone.

Using the Companion:
1 : On your computer, pull the .aia file from the repo.
2 : On your computer, go to ai2.appinventor.mit.edu
3 : On your computer, under the Projects menu, select "Import project (.aia) from my computer".
4 : On your android device, download MIT AI2 Companion and open it.
5 : On your computer, Under the Connect Menu, select "AI Companion."
6 : On your android device, select "scan QR code" and scan the code now present on your computer screen.
7 : The app should launch.

Downloading the APK:
1 : On your computer, pull the .apk file from the repo.
2 : Connect you android device to your computer.
3 : Install the APK onto your android device.  (Depending on your device, you may need to allow applications from unknown sources or download an application manager.)
4 : Select the application.
